The first version is deployed to [`0x1604AC39a9e19Fb8c1D8ccF3EC42e80D69f4d400`](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x404cf70bda1cca4e7519579c0e601b112eb88b29f2d0df5faa59f43c4ccb83ab).

# Motivation

Last December, I found that the put option in Opyn was much cheaper than the one in Hegic. In Opyn, it cost about **$2.5** to buy a 1 ETH put option with the strike price of $360(expiry is about 24days.) Whereas, in Hegic, it cost about **$57** to buy a 1 ETH put option with the strike price of $360(expiry is 21 days.)

As I list up below, there are more than ten options protocols as of today(Jan 21, 2021). Since each protocol could have different liquidity, a unique pricing formula, and a source of volatility, it'd be useful to get the best option across options protocols both for traders and developers.

- [Hegic](https://www.hegic.co/)
- [Opyn](https;//opyn.co)
- [Primitive](https://primitive.finance/)
- [Charm Finance](https://charm.fi/)
- [Siren](https://sirenmarkets.com/)
- [Auctus](https://app.auctus.org/)
- [Lien](https://lien.finance/)
- [FinNexis](https://finnexus.io/)
- [Pods](https://www.pods.finance/)
- [Premia](https://www.premia.finance/)
- [PowerTrade](https://power.trade/)

On top of these protocols, we could aggregate options from the secondary market as well.

# What This Contract Does

In this first version, I keep a function minimal. You can get the best ETH put option price from Hegic V888 and Opyn V1 by calling a single function.

_The logical extension of this aggregator would be expanding to other derivatives like swaps, futures and forwards._
